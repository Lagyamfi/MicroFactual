## Dataset description


This is example dataset from Zeller_et al_ where they tried to show the potential of fecal microbiota for early-stage detection of colorectal cancer.


abundance_crc.txt contains the relative abundance values of all species identified in all the samples. Hence, a row represents a microbial species and a column represents a sample.


metadata_crc.txt contains all the metadata relevant for the patients involved in the study. We are interested in the *Group* column which indicates whether a patient is a healthy control or colorectal cancer 
patient.
